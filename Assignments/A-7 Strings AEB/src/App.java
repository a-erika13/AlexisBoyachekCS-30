        \\Your code for part one should remove the word “very ” (and following space) from message1 and print the new message.

        \\You must use .indexOf() to find the start position of a the part of the string you want to remove.

        \\You need to use .length() to find the end point of the string you want to remove.

        \\You can then use .substring() to create a new string removing the word
